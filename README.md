# BashScripts
Random Bash Script files that do some cool stuff.

## < Permission Denied >
- You need to allow file to run the code, use:
- `chmod +x /path/to/exampleScript.sh` 

#### IterateIP.sh
- Use this at your own risk, or at least have permission with the users in the cureent netwrok, since it will ping users in the network
- When IterateIP.sh begins, it will try to ping other devices in the network
- Tell your friends in the network to open up `netstat` and they will see your device pinging theirs!
